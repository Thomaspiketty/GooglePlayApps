# Analysis of Google Play Apps

Data from Datacamp.com project.

To find some meaning of the data.

I'm still in process.

Untill now I focused about categories and Price.

More than 90% what users download is free app.

If I focus only about paid-app. Family Category and Medical Category are sold with higher price than other categories.
